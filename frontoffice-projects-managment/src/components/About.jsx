      <p className='my-4'>Many project planning and management tools are currently being marketed,
         with the majority of these tools leveraging the web. In the same context,
          we have developed a small part of a JEE application that can assist a project manager in planning projects
           by creating tasks, assigning stakeholders to these tasks, and managing temporal constraints,
         stakeholders' skills, leave, and holidays. The primary goal is to achieve optimal project durations.</p>
